# 1st Progress Report: 2/24/23

2/20: I didn't commit often enough and accidentally deleted my original `data_parsing.ipynb`, losing an hour or two of work.

2/23 - 2/24: I wrote the parser and refined it to the point that it gets through all the data without erroring! There are still improvements to be made, but it handles probably about 98% of the sound changes correctly. I've put a ton of information on this in [data_parsing.ipynb](data_parsing.ipynb). The output data can be found at [data/rules.json](data/rules.json) and [data/branches.json](data/branches.json), although they're pretty large files.

## Data sharing plan

All of my data will be included under [the data directory](data/), as it is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, which allows the sharing of the data, as long as the shared data is also licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0.
